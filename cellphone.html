            If you’ve ever attempted to live tweet a sunrise from the plains of Bagan in Myanmar, snapchat your latte from the terraces of Santorini in Greece, or simply purchase a SIM card in a country other than the US, you may have noticed how cheap data plans are in the rest of the world. Anecdotally, I pay about $60 a month for my unlimited plan. My boyfriend pays about $80 a month for his unlimited plan. These numbers seem outrageous to me since I spend the holidays in India, where my data plan was about $5 for enough data to last me my whole multi-week trip. The question about cell service pricing in the US is especially pertinent right now as Sprint and T-Mobile hover on the cusp of a merger. This stands to impact hundreds of millions of consumers in America, so it is worth considering if Americans are getting the short end of the stick. If so, why is this the case?

            In the US, the players of the game are AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint (US cellular also exists, but is much smaller and does not have a national 4G network). So right now, the US market has 4 mobile network operators, or MNOs. If TMobile and Sprint merge, however, we’ll drop down to a 3-MNO market. If you ever paid attention in middle school, you may remember being taught about antitrust laws, the harms of oligopolies and the wonderful promises of competition in American capitalism. So, spoiler alert, we might want to pay close attention to what happens when competitive markets become less so.

            Alright, enough speculation, let’s dig into some data about cell service. It turns out that the average American pays about $35.62 according to data from 2014 by The International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The ITU also surveyed 172 other countries and found that the United States ranks 6th in terms of the most expensive mobile plans by absolute price. Admittedly, comparing the US against under-developed countries is slightly unfair so for the rest of the analysis, I’ll stick to comparing the US against other European and OECD countries. Residents of many developing nations have average incomes that are an order of magnitude or more lower than the United States, and so plans are often priced much lower. Even besides this, the economies are so different that limiting scope here made sense. First, let’s pull out the top 15 most populated EU countries to compare against the US to get a snapshot for what metrics we should care about. The chart below is ordered by largest in population size.
