            Why is my cellphone bill so high?

        <p>
            If you’ve ever attempted to live tweet a sunrise from the plains of Bagan in Myanmar, snapchat your latte
            from the terraces of Santorini in Greece, or simply purchase a SIM card in a country other than the US, you
            may have noticed how cheap data plans are in the rest of the world. Anecdotally, I pay about $60 a month for
            my unlimited plan. My boyfriend pays about $80 a month for his unlimited plan. These numbers seem outrageous
            to me since I spend the holidays in India, where my data plan was about $5 for enough data to last me my
            whole multi-week trip. The question about cell service pricing in the US is especially pertinent right now
            as Sprint and T-Mobile hover on the cusp of a merger. This stands to impact hundreds of millions of
            consumers in America, so it is worth considering if Americans are getting the short end of the stick. If so,
            why is this the case?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the US, the players of the game are AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint (US cellular also exists, but is
            much smaller and does not have a national 4G network). So right now, the US market has 4 mobile network
            operators, or MNOs. If TMobile and Sprint merge, however, we’ll drop down to a 3-MNO market. If you ever
            paid attention in middle school, you may remember being taught about antitrust laws, the harms of
            oligopolies and the wonderful promises of competition in American capitalism. So, spoiler alert, we might
            want to pay close attention to what happens when competitive markets become less so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright, enough speculation, let’s dig into some data about cell service. It turns out that the average
            American pays about $35.62 according to data from 2014 by The International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
            The ITU also surveyed 172 other countries and found that the United States ranks 6th in terms of the most
            expensive mobile plans by absolute price. Admittedly, comparing the US against under-developed countries is
            slightly unfair so for the rest of the analysis, I’ll stick to comparing the US against other European and
            OECD countries. Residents of many developing nations have average incomes that are an order of magnitude or
            more lower than the United States, and so plans are often priced much lower. Even besides this, the
            economies are so different that limiting scope here made sense. First, let’s pull out the top 15 most
            populated EU countries to compare against the US to get a snapshot for what metrics we should care about.
            The chart below is ordered by largest in population size.

            Restricting my analysis in this way, the US is 3rd when looking at the mean price paid for a cell phone plan, beaten only by the Netherlands and France. So, insta-ing your macaron, or President Macron, will be pricey. The US is also in the top three when comparing the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of cell phone service. A quick note on PPP: the idea behind this metric is that it should correct for the difference in the cost of living in different countries. PPPs are currency conversion rates that equalize the purchasing power across currencies by taking into account the price of some base basket of goods in each currency. This should be a much better metric when comparing the cost of any good across different countries since it ostensibly controls for the differences in purchasing power.

            You may notice that the US is not anywhere close to the top three when looking at the average percent of income people spend on their service plan. I’d argue this isn’t a very good metric, however. The US is, after all, a pretty wealthy country, and some of the fixed costs associated with providing cell service makes this fact unsurprising. After all, Lambos aren’t cheaper in India just because the average income is lower there. But more importantly, countries with higher income inequality have artificially depressed average percentage of incomes they spend on a particular good, since really rich people spend a truly miniscule percentage of their income on their cell phone plan. According to the World Bank Gini Coefficient, which is supposed to be a good measure of the income inequality present in a country, of the list of countries posted above, the US has the highest level of inequality, at a Gini Coefficient of 41.5. It would be interesting to look at the median percent income spent on cell phone plans instead of the average, but I haven’t located this data yet.

            Alright, so it does seem that the US is surely towards the more expensive side, but it is important to note that this data does not control for what buyers are actually getting for their money. If US residents pay half as much for 1/10th of the data allotment, they are still being overcharged. Or visa-versa, by paying twice as much but only getting a bit more, US residents  would still be worse off. Rewheel, a Finnish research firm, released a report in October of 2018 that included a large scale analysis of the available plans in a variety of countries. They found that the US was the 5th highest median gigabyte price for 4G plans with 1000+ minutes when compared against all the 41 EU and OECD countries. For pure data plans, the US is the highest median gigabyte price. So on average, people in the US are not only paying more in total than residents in most EU countries, but they are also paying more per GB of data!

            One of the more interesting aspects of the Rewheel analysis was its consideration of how many MNOs are in each market. For example, they found that the median price per GB of data in the US is 4x higher than EU countries with the same number of mobile providers:
