          </a>
        <p>
        Being a tad bit of a perfectionist, I realized that I have a tendency
        not to put up a lot of work I have done because there are things about
        it I would change. But, because of school, time to perfect things rarely exists right now,
        and I'm still in the process of learning and growing.

        So, I decided I should put some work up and tell you all about what I
        would change about it given more time, rather than waiting until it's
        perfect. Here are some of the things I have worked on over the last few
        years.

              <p>A project from my data viz class. The challenge was to build an
              accurate and inventive clock using p5.js. I chose to invoke the
              anxiety associated with climate change with my doomsday clock. Given
              more time, I would build this out further to include facts about
              climate change with every drop, and add markings to make the clock
              aspect more readable.</p>

              <p>The final project for my advanced topics in databases class: a
              research paper that analyzed various performance optimizations for
              performing in-memory query perturbation with Pandas dataframes. Query
              perturbation is the idea of having a query template on a database, and
              varying a certain set of parameters to search for a particular result
              in your database! While the features described in the paper were
              implemented, what I would improve in the future is the organization of
              the code, and make it a fully functioning system with documentation
              that everyday Pandas users could install and actually use.</p>

              issues your system was having. I worked at a hardware company at the
              time, so I gave a talk on how to debug systems when the bug could be a
              software problem, a hardware problem, or both!</p>

              episode, I played the role of the executive producer, and had an audio
              feature story. One thing I would change given more time is the recording of my
              narration, which due to Covid, I couldn't access the sound booth at
              school! But other than that I had a great time making this podcast
              with my classmates!</p>

              A group project for Dataviz. We grabbed NYC's public
              transportation turnstile data, and processed, cleaned, and
              visualized the data in a multitude of ways to understand which
              neighborhoods were able to stay at home when the pandemic began,
              and which neighborhoods were still forced to go to work. We
              further compared this to the average income in various
              neighborhoods by joining our turnstile data with census data in
              order to understand the economic trends. The whole site is less
              polished than I would want it to be. Some of the visuals are heavy
              and load slowly, and could be scaled down in order to have a faster
              and cleaner page load. Initially we were trying to create a smooth
              scrolling effect, but ran out of time to do so. Some of the
              visuals also take too long as time progresses, and should be sped
              up. All are fixable problems given more time!

              A group project for Dataviz to practice d3. We grabbed the 2018
              Congressional Race SEC filings to try to understand how much
              spending on the race correlated with winning. Knowing what I know
              about D3 now, I would have totally restructured the code, and
              perhaps tried a different visualization to better show the effects
              of spending on the chances of winning. But it was fun to practice
              implementing pop-ups and the clicking behavior in d3.

              the episode if I could!
