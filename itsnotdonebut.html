          <p>A project from my data viz class. The challenge was to build an
          accurate and inventive clock using p5.js. I chose to invoke the
          anxiety associated with climate change with my doomsday clock.</p>

          <p>The final project for my advanced topics in databases class. A
          research paper that analyzed various performance optimizations for
          performing in-memory query perturbation with Pandas dataframes. Query
          perturbation is the idea of having a query template on a database, and
          varying a certain set of parameters to search for a particular result
          in your database!</p>

          <p>A conference talk I gave at the o11ycon Observability conference
          which was centered around how to detect bugs and gain insight into
          issues your system was having. I worked at a hardware company at the
          time, so I gave a talk on how to debug systems when the bug could be a
          software problem, a hardware problem, or both!</p>

          <p>Two episodes of a podcast created for our Audio class. In this
          episode, I played the role of the executive producer, and had an audio
          feature story. One thing I would change given more time is the recording of my
          narration, which due to Covid, I couldn't access the sound booth at
          school! But other than that I had a great time making this podcast
          with my classmates!</p>

          learned a lot during this process!</p>
