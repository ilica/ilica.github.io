          Ilica Mahajan: It's not done but...
          </h1></a>
        <p>
        Being a tad bit of a perfectionist, I realized that I have a tendency
        not to put up a lot of work I have done because there are things about
        it I would change. But, because of school, time to perfect things rarely exists right now,
        and I'm still in the process of learning and growing.

        So, I decided I should put some work up and tell you all about what I
        would change about it given more time, rather than waiting until it's
        perfect. Here are some of the things I have worked on over the last few
        years.

              <p>A project from my data viz class. The challenge was to build an
              accurate and inventive clock using p5.js. I chose to invoke the
              anxiety associated with climate change with my doomsday clock. Given
              more time, I would build this out further to include facts about
              climate change with every drop, and add markings to make the clock
              aspect more readable.</p>

              <p>The final project for my advanced topics in databases class. A
              research paper that analyzed various performance optimizations for
              performing in-memory query perturbation with Pandas dataframes. Query
              perturbation is the idea of having a query template on a database, and
              varying a certain set of parameters to search for a particular result
              in your database! While the features described in the paper were
              implemented, what I would improve in the future is the organization of
              the code, and make it a fully functioning system with documentation
              that everyday Pandas users could install and actually use.</p>

              <p>A conference talk I gave at the o11ycon Observability conference
              which was centered around how to detect bugs and gain insight into
              issues your system was having. I worked at a hardware company at the
              time, so I gave a talk on how to debug systems when the bug could be a
              software problem, a hardware problem, or both!</p>

              <p>Two episodes of a podcast created for our Audio class. In this
              episode, I played the role of the executive producer, and had an audio
              feature story. One thing I would change given more time is the recording of my
              narration, which due to Covid, I couldn't access the sound booth at
              school! But other than that I had a great time making this podcast
              with my classmates!</p>
