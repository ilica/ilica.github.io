    <p><strong>To the management of America’s nonprofit newsrooms:</strong></p>

    <p>
        We are writing to you as the nation’s first-ever caucus of nonprofit newsroom
        unions, which is composed of the media workers representing journalism outlets
        across the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once again, our industry finds itself at an inflection point, facing the
        uncertainty of artificial intelligence. Like any new technology, AI can provide
        a potent new tool to assist us in our work if it is used responsibly,
        thoughtfully and ethically.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we have already seen numerous failures in the implementation of AI
        at for-profit news outlets, where the economic incentive to use AI recklessly
        has at times degraded the otherwise high-caliber product our colleagues
        produce. From Axel Springer to Gannett, major for-profit publishers have
        unveiled flawed AI tools that are hallucinating false news articles or
        synopses, slowing down journalists’ workflows and otherwise threatening
        their editorial product.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nonprofit newsrooms can and must do better to uphold the mandates of our
        mission-driven organizations and ensure readers’ trust in our editorial
        product. Importantly, we are not calling for a ban on AI. Our message is
        simple — management must work with us to determine how to best implement
        this emerging technology and protect journalistic integrity.
    </p>

    <p>
        To that end, we unequivocally demand that you commit to the following
        guardrails around AI in current or future collective bargaining agreements
        and in the implementation of such contracts:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            AI is rapidly evolving and most of its uses remain to be seen. Our unions
            will retain the right to bargain over its future implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Management will not lay off media workers as a result of implementing AI.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our members will not be disciplined if we decide AI is not the best tool for
            a job, and our members’ usage of AI tools will not be surveilled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our outlets will not publish work that is entirely AI-generated, including,
            but not limited to, text, photos, videos, audio, translations or artwork.
            When we publish AI-assisted work, it will be clearly labeled as such, will
            be checked by a human editor and will follow a public ethics policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Management will not strike deals to use our work — or the work of freelancers
            or contributors — to train AI without both our consent and our compensation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Many nonprofit newsrooms have already agreed to common-sense AI provisions,
        and we applaud them. Publications including Grist, the Associated Press,
        CalMatters/The Markup and the Chicago Reader enshrined contract language that
        included such guardrails as protecting unit members against being laid off as a
        result of AI and only implementing new AI tools when the unit consents.
    </p>

    <p>
        But some nonprofit newsrooms appear set on racing to the bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
        Management at ProPublica, which stands at the forefront of investigative
        journalism, has repeatedly refused in negotiations with its workers to agree
        to even the most basic limits on publishing AI-generated content or laying off
        media workers as a result. At The Marshall Project, the preeminent source for
        enterprise reporting on the criminal justice system, management has gone many
        months without responding to their workers’ contract proposal concerning AI.
        At VTDigger, which provides vital local news to Vermonters, management has
        offered insulting AI provisions that would allow them to lay off reporters as
        a result of AI and that include zero guardrails for unionized journalists on
        how AI impacts their editorial product. And at The Texas Tribune, a
        distinguished voice covering the Lone Star State, after previously agreeing to
        AI guardrails, including layoff protections, management recently rejected these
        provisions in favor of unchecked discretion to roll out AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our newsrooms’ readers and small-dollar donors have already expressed their
        displeasure with the poor decisions leaders of the media industry are making
        with respect to AI. Our colleagues at for-profit newsrooms are providing
        cautionary tales. And now, we, the journalists and staff who produce the
        country’s nonprofit news, demand that you work with us to protect the integrity
        of our work and ensure AI is used responsibly. The future of journalism depends
        on it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Respectfully,</strong></p>

    <p>
        The unionized journalists and media workers of CalMatters/The Markup,
        the Central Valley Journalism Collaborative, Chicago Sun-Times,
        Consumer Reports, EdSource, In These Times, Jacobin, High Country News,
        The Marshall Project, MinnPost, New York Focus, ProPublica,
        The Salt Lake Tribune, Spotlight PA, The Texas Tribune, VTDigger and
        contributors from the National Writers Union's Freelance Solidarity Project
